                Ode to Joel, I guess this is he portion of the portfolio where we tell who we are, and how we became this way (This is going to be great).
             Well as stated before my name is Joel, and I am hispanic, and was raised in a very traditional hispanic family household. By traditional I mean everything you eat at "Camino Real" was served on a daily basis, which is why I barely eat mexican food today......I know, I know, I am a disgrace to my race. I grew up with two sisters who are older then me, making me the youngest. Having two sisters
            made me extreme tough from all the beatings, but I cant complain they taught me to cook, dance and sow!

                    My mother was always huge on stablity in a career, which is how I found myself in banking. I loved it, I started off as a teller and worked my way 
                to being in IT. On the way I was able to meet some amazing customers and collegues who have contiued to support me with my goals. I am extremely excited to complete my next goal in life by becoming a full stack developer! Most of my friends and family haver no clue I am taking these courses. I want to be able to suprise them with a new skill set, and I cant wait to be able to be more of an asset to my collegues.
